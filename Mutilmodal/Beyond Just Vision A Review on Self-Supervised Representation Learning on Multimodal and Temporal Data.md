# Beyond Just Vision: A Review on Self-Supervised Representation Learning on Multimodal and Temporal Data

self-supervised learning, transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and active learning alleviate the limitation of labelled datasets.

## Categorised
- Jing and tian categorised self-supervised learning problems into the following four types:
  - generation models
  - context-based models
  - semantic-based models
  - cross-modality models
- Le-Khak  divided SSRL methods into
  - generative
  - discriminative 
  - contrastive
